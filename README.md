# [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): why use it?

This source code was generated by [@GleysonLF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gleysonlf) to talk about what Next.js is and what motivates us to use this framework. Understand a little about SPA, SSR, SSG and how each of them has relevance for web applications. In this presentation we also saw some resources made available by this solution that make our day to day a lot easier.

## Conheça a comunidade

We have a very active community of developers and ReactJS enthusiasts in Ceará. Come and be a part, visit: [React.js Ceará](linktr.ee/react.js.ceara)

## What is inside?

This project uses lot of stuff as:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)

## Getting Started

First, to create a project using this boilerplate, use this command:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/gleysonlf/next-concepts
```

**Optional**: If you use yarn to install the dependencies, after install enter in folder of project and remove yarn.lock in the project and install all dependencies using this command:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Commands

- `dev`: runs your application on `localhost:3000`
- `build`: creates the production build version
- `start`: starts a simple server with the build production code
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
- `test:watch`: runs jest in watch mode
- `prepare`: starts husky install and configuration
